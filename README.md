# WENO for linear hyperbolic system

This is an implementation of the fifth order finite difference WENO based on
paper:

Jiang, G.-S., & Peng, D. (2000). Weighted ENO Schemes for Hamilton--Jacobi
Equations. SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, 21(6), 2126â€“2143.
doi:10.1137/S106482759732455X

## Why using this algorithm?

Linear hyperbolic system is a particular case of the
system of Hamilton--Jacobi equations.

## Scripts

Folder `bin` contains examples for systems where matrix elements are constants
and functions of x.
